# Content Base[^1]

![This image is unrelated to the article, but necessary to design for. Â© Jarred Bishop](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7024/6774040597_370f5c5004_z.jpg)

This repo is a test bed for content design. It is all the elements that can be used within an article you should design for and also a set of css rules to optimise your content for legibility on various devices.

## Requirements

- [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) or [zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/)

## Features

- designed for markdown-esq content (separated from the design), supports footnotes and magazine style images and blockquotes pulled to the left and right with classes of .left or .right
- responsive to a degree (but not obsessive) 3 breakpoints is manageable
- styles are constrained to parent class __.content-base__, as to not effect your layout etc

## Notes

### Pixels or ems?

I've used __pixels__ as a unit of measurement because that's what I'm used to. I'm aware that _ems_ are probably the way forward, and will port the project at some point once I have a better understanding of how they break down.

### Warranty/Support

None whatsoever. Use at your own risk. Be a grown up. If you fix something, create and issue, fork the project and send me a pull request.

### &times; device pixel density resolution browser version support?

Chut up.
